# Sanity Clean Content Studio

Congratulations, you have now installed the Sanity Content Studio, an open source real-time content editing environment connected to the Sanity backend.

Now you can do the following things:

- [Read “getting started” in the docs](https://www.sanity.io/docs/introduction/getting-started?utm_source=readme)
- [Join the community Slack](https://slack.sanity.io/?utm_source=readme)
- [Extend and build plugins](https://www.sanity.io/docs/content-studio/extending?utm_source=readme)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Open the Studio running locally in your preferred browser on http://localhost:3333.

You should now see a screen like the one below prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used to access [sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) when you authenticated with the CLI.
